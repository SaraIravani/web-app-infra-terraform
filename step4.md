# Step 4: Add S3 Bucket for Static File Storage

## Objective
Create an **S3 Bucket** to store static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript for your application.

## Overview
This module manages **external data storage** using **AWS S3**. It is designed to securely store and serve static files required by your application while providing **scalability** and **reliability**.

## Key Features

- **Automatic S3 Bucket Creation** – Simplifies the setup process for static file storage.
- **Versioning Enabled** – Tracks and restores previous versions of files for better data management.
- **Bucket Policies Configuration** – Enforces access permissions through fine-grained policies.
- **IAM Integration** – Enhances security with role-based access controls.
- **Public Access Block** – Ensures data privacy by blocking public access by default.

## Purpose

- **Static File Storage** – Store images, videos, and CSS/JavaScript files securely.
- **Controlled Access** – Provide flexible access rules (public or private).
- **Version Control** – Manage file versions for rollback and recovery.
- **Security Enforcement** – Protect data with policies and IAM roles.

## Components

1. **S3 Bucket** – Primary storage location for static files.
2. **Bucket Versioning** – Enables version tracking and rollback.
3. **Bucket Policy** – Manages access control rules and permissions.
4. **IAM Role & Policies** – Ensures secure, role-based access management.

## Steps Performed

1. **S3 Bucket Creation** – Dynamically created a bucket with environment-specific naming conventions.
2. **Enabled Versioning** – Configured versioning to track and restore file changes.
3. **Bucket Policies Configuration** – Set rules to enforce access controls.
4. **Blocked Public Access** – Ensured data privacy by blocking unauthorized public access.
5. **IAM Policy Application** – Integrated IAM policies for secure role-based access management.

## Next Steps

1. **Application Integration** – Connect your application to the S3 Bucket using **AWS SDK** or **CLI**.
2. **Testing** – Upload and access static files in the bucket to validate configuration.
3. **Monitoring** – Use **AWS CloudWatch** for logs, metrics, and activity monitoring.

## Notes

- **IAM Configuration** – Double-check required IAM roles and policies.
- **Policy Verification** – Ensure bucket policies prevent unintended public access.
- **Troubleshooting** – Use AWS CLI or Management Console for debugging and monitoring.
